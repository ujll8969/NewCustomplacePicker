    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    2C:CD:6D:C3:1E:37:48:39:4B:30:C4:C9:56:4B:13:43:06:97:52:26

    2C:CD:6D:C3:1E:37:48:39:4B:30:C4:C9:56:4B:13:43:06:97:52:26

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
